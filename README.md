# KMeans-clustering
Given tweeter dataset we have to cluster different tweets based on their subject. 
Kmeans is used and intertia (ELBOW) method is used for evaluation. 
Also PCA is used for visualiza the clustering.
The tweet is converted in tf-idf vector and run clustering. 
Also the tweet is converted in word_2_vect and run clustering.
